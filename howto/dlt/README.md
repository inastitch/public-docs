# DLT

Each computer (camera system and stitcher) runs a DLT daemon.

The stitcher board has a fixed IP address: ``10.42.0.1``.
The camera boards have IP address chosen by the DHCP server running is the Ethernet switch. Please use the web interface of the switch at: ``http://10.42.0.254`` to find the IP addresses of the camera systems.
