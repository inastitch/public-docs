 - ``One`` (1): Enable/disable overlay

## Smartphone and VLC
The Ethernet switch includes a WiFi hotspot. Connect to the SSID ``InatechDemo`` on 5G WiFi (there is no password). Once connected, open the following link with Android VLC:

**Note**: The delay of the stream displayed in VLC is caused by VLC which is buffering 1000ms of video by default.
